Single Page Dashboard On HR Analytics_Part1
Objective:
Help an organization toimprove employee performance and improve
employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating a HR Analytics Dashboard.

Scope of Porject : 
Key Factors behind the employee attrition rate.

1.Employee count + Gender
2.Age distribution (Count of Employee and Age) and then compare it with attrition rate and derive what age group contribute to maximum attrition
3. Department and Employee attrition.
4. Education field attrition rate under various sub-categories.

1. Cleaned Duplicates and Null vlaues using the Query Editor
2. Added card on EmpID to capture the count of employees.
3. then added attrition but to add attrition I need to create a column where we can count the yes and no values so, I used transform section to create
conditinal columns where 'Yes' will return 1 and 'No, will return 0
4. Now I have created Piechart "Attrition By Education"
5. Stacked column chart by Attrition by Age
6. Matrix Table, where the Satisfaction level marked by Job role and then compared further as per Attrition Count.
7. Created Clustered bar chart to show the attrition by Salary Slab
8. Created Area graph to show Attrition by Years in Company.
9. Lastly created a clustered bar chart to show Attrition by Role

--->Finally have segregated the dashboard view by Applying 2 filter criterions, One for Male and Female basis the gender and the other is to get a view accross
departments in the organisation, there are three such dept. Human Resource, Research & Development and finally Sales.
